Title: I cannot live with you
Author: Emily Dickinson

i cannot live with you,
it would be life,
and life is over there
behind the shelf

the sexton keeps the key to,
putting up
our life, his porcelain,
like a cup
discarded of the housewife,
quaint or broken;
a newer Sèvres pleases,

Old ones crack.
i could not die with you,
for one must wait,
to shut the other’s gaze down,-
you could not.

And i, could i stand by
and see you freeze,
without my right of frost,
death’s privilege?
nor could i rise with you,
because your face
would put out Jesus’
that new grace

Grow plain and foreign
on my homesick eye,
except that you, than he
shone closer by.

They’d judge us- how?
for you served heaven, you know,
or sought to;
I could not,

Because you saturated sight,
and i had no more eyes
for sordid excellence
as paradise.

And were you lost, I would be,
though my name

Rang loudest
on the heavenly fame.
and were you saved,
and i condemned to be
where you were not,
that self were hell to me.

So we must keep apart,
you there, I here,
with just the door ajar
that oceans are,
and prayer,
and that pale sustenance,

Despair!

Title: Remindance
Author: Tim Bernardes

So many washings had passed
When she found, buried in her pockets
A pair of pennies and a forgotten old note.
From a forgotten man, also old, she loved
Happy to celebrate the year that had passed,
"Happy New Year, for the both of us", it said,
"I love you, dear. You're the one thing in my head"
She had forgotten the man of the past
Forgetting was just moving on to endure
The bitter goodbyes
Refused to remember the good things he left,
Only the bad things, she guessed
Were what drove her away
He was nothing anymore.
"I wonder what he's up to now"
She thought of
The old and faded memory of a love.
The note was a cross she carried around
Buried deep in her denim pockets
All of this time unfound
She smiled shamefully, with the note in her hands
His voice read out loud the opening line
"You look so beautiful!"
The love is still here, and will hang on
For many, many more washings to come.
Happy New Year for the both of us, he said
I love you dear, you're the one thing in my head.

Title: Last August Hours Before the Year 2000 
Author: Naomi Shihab Nye

Spun silk of mercy, 
long-limbed afternoon,
sun urging purple blossoms from baked stems. 
What better blessing than to move without hurry
under trees?
Lugging a bucket to the rose that became a twining
house by now, roof and walls of vine-
you could live inside this rose. 
Pouring a slow stream around the 
ancient pineapple crowned with spiky fruit, 
I thought we would feel old
by the year 2000. 
Walt Disney thought cars would fly.
What a drama to keep thinking the last summer
the last birthday
before the calendar turns to zeroes. 
My neighbor says anything we plant
in September takes hold. 
She’s lining pots of little grasses by her walk. 
I want to know the root goes deep
on all that came before, 
you could lay a soaker hose across
your whole life and know
there was something
Under layers of packed summer earth
and dry blown grass
to moisten.

Title: Chega de Saudade
Author: Tom Jobim

Go, my sorrows,
And tell her that there's no way without her.
Ask of her in a prayer, ask her to return
Because I can't suffer any longer.
I'm done with longing
Truthfully, without her there's no peace
There's no beauty, only sadness and melancholy
That will never leave me, never leave me, never will.
But if she returns!
What a lovely thing, what a crazy thing
Because there are less fish swimming by
Than the love I'll give to you when you're with me
Inside my embrace,
There will be a million hugs
Tight like this, glued together like this, silently like this
Hugs and little kisses and caresses neverending
So that you'll end the whole 'far away from me' thing.
I want no more of this 'living without me' thing!
There is no peace, no beauty
It's only sadness and melancholy
That will never leave me, never leave me, never will.

Title: Lovers of the Digital Age
Author: Ivy

sometimes when i send you these emails, i think about the great love affairs of the past, their letters and hearts laid bare for the world to scrutinise after their death. and i wonder. would that ever happen to us? would these emails be collected and shared in a weekly newsletter, “the letters of ivy liu and liz caminha”? will you be the only one to  ever read this, or am i addressing the world right now? 
its such a game to love people in the age of the internet. a dance, almost. the back and forth of posts, quotes, memes, videos, all in hopes that the other will see it and laugh, or cry, or just feel something. after i send this email, too, the ball will be in your court. what will you respond with? will it make me smile? will i learn something new? thats what i think, every time i open your chat or your message. 
and then sometimes, i post something on my story that i’ll know you’ll enjoy. and i know that every time, you’ll see it and understand and appreciate it.
in the alison bechdel article i sent you, the vita and virginia one, one bit struck me as interesting. something along the lines of “if they existed today, there would be countless text messages and calls that would slip through our fingers. but they wrote physical letters, and thats why we’re able to read them now.” and that made me think of you, for obvious reasons. i can’t count the amount of conversations we’ve had, riffing off each other endlessly, feeling like the most important people in the world. 
perhaps we are.
those conversations can’t be saved, will never be put out to the world, but emails can. everything sent out to the internet is on there forever. we aren’t the first to experience this special brand of love, built on emails and shared links and “i saw this and thought of you” and we definitely won’t be the last. somewhere out there, theres a record of all of that. the emails, the confessions, the stories. all the lovers of the digital age. 
i can only hope we measure up to them. 
if i could pick one thing to leave behind, one thing that the world will remember me for when i die, i’d pick these emails. “the letters from ivy liu to liz caminha”. if my only impact on the world is this friendship, i will have done something right after all. if they publish these emails, let me scream it to the world from the rooftops! i lived and cried and laughed like everyone else, and i love liz! 
but i write for you and me, not the world. and at least for now, id like to keep it that way.

Title: Gmail doesn't have an 'unsend' button
Author: Liz

despite all of my arteries, i've been lacking in our love letters.
sounds insane, but it does feel that way when my heart races as i see your name on my inbox.
"what else is new to see? did this remind her of me?"
routinely, an erratic read. a light on my day. routinely, my fingers grip your emails tight, almost as if it were your own handwriting on a weathered piece of paper, not arial on a blue led screen.
but it feels real...
despite my better judgement, or any judgement of mine,
i'll click send.
is it not the same?
gmail doesn't have an unsend button.
a letter i sent is not mine anymore. but electronic mail doesn't return to the sender.
i could ask you to delete this upon arrival.
THIS MESSAGE WILL SELF-DESTRUCT
but you'd keep it, wouldn't you? maybe keep it from me. isn't every lett- or, well, electronic mail, just a part of me i won't get back?
how is it not real?
despite my hypothalamus,
the email you sent me will stay unresponded.
it can't be helped. how selfish is it to put into words what i felt when i saw...
mail in the mailbox
in your handwriting, not arial,
a pink, scented envelope laced with pure adrenaline, not more than words on a screen.
yet, still, in the palm of my hand.
it feels just as real.
despite all of my sorrows,
i'm sorry for not responding.
it's a force beyond myself. i can't bear to read what you write to me but fuck,
i somehow do it anyways. always. 
god, you're poison, ivy.
you're poison and you're real as ever.
despite the bullshit i just said,
know deep down i mean it.
and i mean this too: sorry for making you read it.
it's beyond me!
but i know deep down you'll like it.
despite my beating, real ass pumping heart,
i love you,
sleep well,
i hope i regret this when i hit send.

Title: A Note (Bilhete)
Author: Mário Quintana

If you ought to love me, love me quietly,
Don't yell it from the rooftops.
Leave the little birds be
Leave me be!
If you want me,
alas,
it will have to be very slowly, my love.
for life is brief, but love is even briefer...
If you ought to forget me, just know one thing:
forget me without any hurry.

Title: This
Author: Ralph Angel

 Today, my love
leaves are thrashing against the wind
just as pedestrians are erecting again the buildings
of this drab
forbidding city,
and our lives, as I lose track of them,
are the lives of others derailing in time and
getting things done.
Impossible to make sense of any one face
or mouth, though
each distance
is clear, and you are miles
from here.
Let your pure
space crowd my heart.
that we might star a while longer amid the flying debris.
This moment,
I swear it,
isn’t going anywhere.

Title: By heavens! (上邪)
Author: Unknown

Even when mountains flatten and riverbeds run dry, 
And the earth moves to become one with the sky,
Even when winter thunders and summer snows,
Never will my love do anything but grow.

Title: Fragment Thirty-Six
Author: Hilda Doolittle & Sappho

I know not what to do,
my mind is reft:
is song's gift best?
is love's gift loveliest?
I know not what to do,
now sleep has pressed
weight on your eyelids.

Shall I break your rest,
devouring, eager?
is love's gift best?
nay, song's the loveliest:
yet were you lost,
what rapture 
could I take from song?
what song were left?

I know not what to do:
to turn and slake
the rage that burns,
with my breath burn
and trouble your cool breath?
so shall I turn and take
snow in my arms?
(is love's gift best?)
yet flake on flake
of snow were comfortless,
did you lie wondering,
wakened yet unawake.

Shall I turn and take
comfortless snow within my arms?
press lips to lips 
that answer not,
press lips to flesh
that shudders not nor breaks?

Is love's gift best?—
shall I turn and slake
all the wild longing?
O I am eager for you!
as the Pleiads shake
white light in whiter water
so shall I take you?

My mind is quite divided,
my minds hesitate,
so perfect matched,
I know not what to do:
each strives with each
as two white wrestlers
standing for a match,
ready to turn and clutch
yet never shake muscle nor nerve nor tendon;
so my mind waits
to grapple with my mind,
yet I lie quiet,
I would seem at rest.

I know not what to do:
strain upon strain,
sound surging upon sound
makes my brain blind;
as a wave-line may wait to fall
yet (waiting for its falling)
still the wind may take
from off its crest,
white flake on flake of foam,
that rises,
seeming to dart and pulse
and rend the light,
so my mind hesitates
above the passion
quivering yet to break,
so my mind hesitates 
above my mind,
listening to song's delight.

I know not what to do:
will the sound break,
rending the night
with rift on rift of rose
and scattered light?
will the sound break at last
as the wave hesitant,
or will the whole night pass
and I lie listening awake?
