Title: I cannot live with you
Author: Emily Dickinson

i cannot live with you,
it would be life,
and life is over there
behind the shelf

the sexton keeps the key to,
putting up
our life, his porcelain,
like a cup
discarded of the housewife,
quaint or broken;
a newer Sèvres pleases,

Old ones crack.
i could not die with you,
for one must wait,
to shut the other’s gaze down,-
you could not.

And i, could i stand by
and see you freeze,
without my right of frost,
death’s privilege?
nor could i rise with you,
because your face
would put out Jesus’
that new grace

Grow plain and foreign
on my homesick eye,
except that you, than he
shone closer by.

They’d judge us- how?
for you served heaven, you know,
or sought to;
I could not,

Because you saturated sight,
and i had no more eyes
for sordid excellence
as paradise.

And were you lost, I would be,
though my name

Rang loudest
on the heavenly fame.
and were you saved,
and i condemned to be
where you were not,
that self were hell to me.

So we must keep apart,
you there, I here,
with just the door ajar
that oceans are,
and prayer,
and that pale sustenance,

Despair!

Title: Last August Hours Before the Year 2000 
Author: Naomi Shihab Nye

Spun silk of mercy, 
long-limbed afternoon,
sun urging purple blossoms from baked stems. 
What better blessing than to move without hurry
under trees?
Lugging a bucket to the rose that became a twining
house by now, roof and walls of vine-
you could live inside this rose. 
Pouring a slow stream around the 
ancient pineapple crowned with spiky fruit, 
I thought we would feel old
by the year 2000. 
Walt Disney thought cars would fly.
What a drama to keep thinking the last summer
the last birthday
before the calendar turns to zeroes. 
My neighbor says anything we plant
in September takes hold. 
She’s lining pots of little grasses by her walk. 
I want to know the root goes deep
on all that came before, 
you could lay a soaker hose across
your whole life and know
there was something
Under layers of packed summer earth
and dry blown grass
to moisten.

Title: Lovers of the Digital Age
Author: Ivy

sometimes when i send you these emails, i think about the great love affairs of the past, their letters and hearts laid bare for the world to scrutinise after their death. and i wonder. would that ever happen to us? would these emails be collected and shared in a weekly newsletter, “the letters of ivy liu and liz caminha”? will you be the only one to  ever read this, or am i addressing the world right now? 
its such a game to love people in the age of the internet. a dance, almost. the back and forth of posts, quotes, memes, videos, all in hopes that the other will see it and laugh, or cry, or just feel something. after i send this email, too, the ball will be in your court. what will you respond with? will it make me smile? will i learn something new? thats what i think, every time i open your chat or your message. 
and then sometimes, i post something on my story that i’ll know you’ll enjoy. and i know that every time, you’ll see it and understand and appreciate it.
in the alison bechdel article i sent you, the vita and virginia one, one bit struck me as interesting. something along the lines of “if they existed today, there would be countless text messages and calls that would slip through our fingers. but they wrote physical letters, and thats why we’re able to read them now.” and that made me think of you, for obvious reasons. i can’t count the amount of conversations we’ve had, riffing off each other endlessly, feeling like the most important people in the world. 
perhaps we are.
those conversations can’t be saved, will never be put out to the world, but emails can. everything sent out to the internet is on there forever. we aren’t the first to experience this special brand of love, built on emails and shared links and “i saw this and thought of you” and we definitely won’t be the last. somewhere out there, theres a record of all of that. the emails, the confessions, the stories. all the lovers of the digital age. 
i can only hope we measure up to them. 
if i could pick one thing to leave behind, one thing that the world will remember me for when i die, i’d pick these emails. “the letters from ivy liu to liz caminha”. if my only impact on the world is this friendship, i will have done something right after all. if they publish these emails, let me scream it to the world from the rooftops! i lived and cried and laughed like everyone else, and i love liz! 
but i write for you and me, not the world. and at least for now, id like to keep it that way.

Title: By heavens! (上邪)
Author: Unknown

Even when mountains flatten and riverbeds run dry, 
And the earth moves to become one with the sky,
Even when winter thunders and summer snows,
Never will my love do anything but grow.

Title: 9 March 1926
Author: Vita Sackville-West
...i have been stuck in a river, crawled between ramparts of snow, been attacked by a bandit, been baked and frozen alternatively, travelled alone with ten men (all strangers), 
slept in odd places, eaten wayside meals, crossed high passes, seen Kurds and Medes and caravans, and running streams, and black lambs skipping under blossom, seen hills of porphyry stained with copper sulphate, snow-mountains in a great circle, endless plains, with flocks on the slopes. 
Dead camels pecked by vultures, a dying donkey, a dying man. Came to mud towns at nightfall, stayed with odd gruff Scotchmen, drunk Persian wine. Worn a silk dress one day, and a sheepskin and fur cap the next. 
Met [my husband], with letters in his pocket, - two letters from Virginia, which I read first. […] And today’s my birthday. 
But all this, as you say, gives no idea at all. How is it that one can never communicate? Only imaginary things can be communicated, like ideas, or the world of a novel, but not real experience 
[…] How i wish I could bring you here; couldn’t you and Leonard come next spring? No of course you won’t. I don’t believe Isfahan and Persepolis are any temptation to you. 
I wish I had a photograph of you. It is a torment not being able to visualise when one wants to. I can visualise you as a matter of fact surprisingly well, - but always as you stood on your door-step that last evening, when the lamps were lit and the trees misty, and I drove away...

Title: The End of Poetry
Author: Ada Limon
Who will believe my verse in time to come
Enough of osseous and chickadee and sunflower
and snowshoes, maple and seeds, samara and shoot,
enough chiaroscuro, enough of thus and prophecy
and the stoic farmer and faith and our father and tis
of thee, enough of bosom and bud, skin and god
not forgetting and star bodies and frozen birds,
enough of the will to go on and not go on or how
a certain light does a certain thing, enough
of the kneeling and the rising and the looking
inward and the looking up, enough of the gun,
the drama, and the acquaintance’s suicide, the long-lost
letter on the dresser, enough of the longing and
the ego and the obliteration of ego, enough
of the mother and the child and the father and the child
and enough of the pointing to the world, weary
and desperate, enough of the brutal and the border,
enough of can you see me, can you hear me, enough
I am human, enough I am alone and I am desperate,
enough of the animal saving me, enough of the high
water, enough sorrow, enough of the air and its ease,
I am asking you to touch me.

Title: With a prayer
Author: Zeina Hashem Beck
The herons were no longer safe in the sky. They flew with prayer,
then fell to us. We hid them from the cats. What to do with prayer?

Decades after the civil war, we enter the sniper’s hole, sew
the sandbags, read words for his boyfriend on the wall, true with prayer.

Write my name & invite me to a wedding. I want a parade
of cars with flashers on, each blinking red, two times two with prayer.

Dear Eurydice, what good a heart that can’t resist looking back?
Foolish, music-laden Orpheus. Almost saved you with prayer.

In the museum of memory, the missing accumulate.
They shoot out of the tiles like grass blades, damp & new with prayer.

I found a photo in a library book: lovers holding hands.
I felt chosen, then lost it. & I didn’t pursue with prayer.

When I interviewed God, I said I moved the plants toward the light,
forgot the water. Is love a lack, always imbued with prayer?

Tarot cards, make me beautiful. Abundance me, O Three of Cups,
spin luck O Wheel of Fortune, I’m through, I’m through, I’m through with prayer.

Title: To L.H.B
Author: Katherine Mansfield
Last night for the first time since you were dead 
I walked with you, my brother, in a dream. 
We were at home again beside the stream 
Fringed with tall berry bushes, white and red. 
‘Don't touch them: they are poisonous,’ I said. 
But your hand hovered, and I saw a beam 
Of strange, bright laughter flying round your head 
And as you stooped I saw the berries gleam. 
‘Don't you remember? We called them Dead Man's Bread!’ 
I woke and heard the wind moan and the roar 
Of the dark water tumbling on the shore. 
Where – where is the path of my dream for my eager feet? 
By the remembered stream my brother stands 
Waiting for me with berries in his hands … 
‘These are my body. Sister, take and eat.

Title: The Conditional
Author: Ada Limón
Say tomorrow doesn't come.
Say the moon becomes an icy pit.
Say the sweet-gum tree is petrified.
Say the sun's a foul black tire fire.
Say the owl's eyes are pinpricks.
Say the raccoon's a hot tar stain.
Say the shirt's plastic ditch-litter.
Say the kitchen's a cow's corpse.
Say we never get to see it: bright
future, stuck like a bum star, never
coming close, never dazzling.
Say we never meet her. Never him.
Say we spend our last moments staring
at each other, hands knotted together,
clutching the dog, watching the sky burn.
Say, It doesn't matter. Say, That would be
enough. Say you'd still want this: us alive,
right here, feeling lucky.

Title: Not Tonight but tomorrow
Author: Michael Algarin
Not tonight but tomorrow
when the light turns the peach
tree green and the Earth sprouts
its young leaves looking to repeat
the magical mystery tour of
photosynthetic conversion of light
and moisture into life—
Not tonight but tomorrow
when my body will have shed
its fear of turning old and soft
will I turn my speeding mind
into the tunnels of your psyche
to melt the calcium that constipates
your synapses into a lubricating powder—
Not tonight but tomorrow
when the Universe moves on
beyond the field of action
that is the Earth to me and you
will I discover the interplanetary clues
that signal the roots of my moment to you—
Not tonight but tomorrow
will I throw my feelings into
New York streets to stew
in the violence and despair
of our planet—
Not tonight but tomorrow
will the Earth turn green again.
