Title: Remindance
Author: Tim Bernardes

So many washings had passed
When she found, buried in her pockets
A pair of pennies and a forgotten old note.
From a forgotten man, also old, she loved
Happy to celebrate the year that had passed,
"Happy New Year, for the both of us", it said,
"I love you, dear. You're the one thing in my head"
She had forgotten the man of the past
Forgetting was just moving on to endure
The bitter goodbyes
Refused to remember the good things he left,
Only the bad things, she guessed
Were what drove her away
He was nothing anymore.
"I wonder what he's up to now"
She thought of
The old and faded memory of a love.
The note was a cross she carried around
Buried deep in her denim pockets
All of this time unfound
She smiled shamefully, with the note in her hands
His voice read out loud the opening line
"You look so beautiful!"
The love is still here, and will hang on
For many, many more washings to come.
Happy New Year for the both of us, he said
I love you dear, you're the one thing in my head.

Title: Chega de Saudade
Author: Tom Jobim

Go, my sorrows,
And tell her that there's no way without her.
Ask of her in a prayer, ask her to return
Because I can't suffer any longer.
I'm done with longing
Truthfully, without her there's no peace
There's no beauty, only sadness and melancholy
That will never leave me, never leave me, never will.
But if she returns!
What a lovely thing, what a crazy thing
Because there are less fish swimming by
Than the love I'll give to you when you're with me
Inside my embrace,
There will be a million hugs
Tight like this, glued together like this, silently like this
Hugs and little kisses and caresses neverending
So that you'll end the whole 'far away from me' thing.
I want no more of this 'living without me' thing!
There is no peace, no beauty
It's only sadness and melancholy
That will never leave me, never leave me, never will.

Title: Gmail doesn't have an 'unsend' button
Author: Liz

despite all of my arteries, i've been lacking in our love letters.
sounds insane, but it does feel that way when my heart races as i see your name on my inbox.
"what else is new to see? did this remind her of me?"
routinely, an erratic read. a light on my day. routinely, my fingers grip your emails tight, almost as if it were your own handwriting on a weathered piece of paper, not arial on a blue led screen.
but it feels real...
despite my better judgement, or any judgement of mine,
i'll click send.
is it not the same?
gmail doesn't have an unsend button.
a letter i sent is not mine anymore. but electronic mail doesn't return to the sender.
i could ask you to delete this upon arrival.
THIS MESSAGE WILL SELF-DESTRUCT
but you'd keep it, wouldn't you? maybe keep it from me. isn't every lett- or, well, electronic mail, just a part of me i won't get back?
how is it not real?
despite my hypothalamus,
the email you sent me will stay unresponded.
it can't be helped. how selfish is it to put into words what i felt when i saw...
mail in the mailbox
in your handwriting, not arial,
a pink, scented envelope laced with pure adrenaline, not more than words on a screen.
yet, still, in the palm of my hand.
it feels just as real.
despite all of my sorrows,
i'm sorry for not responding.
it's a force beyond myself. i can't bear to read what you write to me but fuck,
i somehow do it anyways. always. 
god, you're poison, ivy.
you're poison and you're real as ever.
despite the bullshit i just said,
know deep down i mean it.
and i mean this too: sorry for making you read it.
it's beyond me!
but i know deep down you'll like it.
despite my beating, real ass pumping heart,
i love you,
sleep well,
i hope i regret this when i hit send.

Title: A Note (Bilhete)
Author: Mário Quintana

If you ought to love me, love me quietly,
Don't yell it from the rooftops.
Leave the little birds be
Leave me be!
If you want me,
alas,
it will have to be very slowly, my love.
for life is brief, but love is even briefer...
If you ought to forget me, just know one thing:
forget me without any hurry.

Title: This
Author: Ralph Angel

 Today, my love
leaves are thrashing against the wind
just as pedestrians are erecting again the buildings
of this drab
forbidding city,
and our lives, as I lose track of them,
are the lives of others derailing in time and
getting things done.
Impossible to make sense of any one face
or mouth, though
each distance
is clear, and you are miles
from here.
Let your pure
space crowd my heart.
that we might star a while longer amid the flying debris.
This moment,
I swear it,
isn’t going anywhere.

Title: Fragment Thirty-Six
Author: Hilda Doolittle & Sappho

I know not what to do,
my mind is reft:
is song's gift best?
is love's gift loveliest?
I know not what to do,
now sleep has pressed
weight on your eyelids.

Shall I break your rest,
devouring, eager?
is love's gift best?
nay, song's the loveliest:
yet were you lost,
what rapture 
could I take from song?
what song were left?

I know not what to do:
to turn and slake
the rage that burns,
with my breath burn
and trouble your cool breath?
so shall I turn and take
snow in my arms?
(is love's gift best?)
yet flake on flake
of snow were comfortless,
did you lie wondering,
wakened yet unawake.

Shall I turn and take
comfortless snow within my arms?
press lips to lips 
that answer not,
press lips to flesh
that shudders not nor breaks?

Is love's gift best?—
shall I turn and slake
all the wild longing?
O I am eager for you!
as the Pleiads shake
white light in whiter water
so shall I take you?

My mind is quite divided,
my minds hesitate,
so perfect matched,
I know not what to do:
each strives with each
as two white wrestlers
standing for a match,
ready to turn and clutch
yet never shake muscle nor nerve nor tendon;
so my mind waits
to grapple with my mind,
yet I lie quiet,
I would seem at rest.

I know not what to do:
strain upon strain,
sound surging upon sound
makes my brain blind;
as a wave-line may wait to fall
yet (waiting for its falling)
still the wind may take
from off its crest,
white flake on flake of foam,
that rises,
seeming to dart and pulse
and rend the light,
so my mind hesitates
above the passion
quivering yet to break,
so my mind hesitates 
above my mind,
listening to song's delight.

I know not what to do:
will the sound break,
rending the night
with rift on rift of rose
and scattered light?
will the sound break at last
as the wave hesitant,
or will the whole night pass
and I lie listening awake?

Title: Verses of Trova to an Anonymous Patron
Author: (outtakes from my notes app)
You're an admirer of everything
and I'm an admirer of you;

The mere thought of you
turns me into a mindless fool,
my heart into a noose and a stool
and I'm an admirer of you.

These feelings are a compound fracture
these feelings are an exit wound,
these feelings are a padded room;
and yet I must admire you.

You're my pick of poison,
my favourite disease
a heart that pumps all over
a radioactive unease.

I'm on my knees with gritted teeth!
with you, admiree, I just can't insist.
The church's altar and the gallows see
every lover is a masochist.

I won't stay here singing
these verses of trova with a bandolin
to reflections of reflections,
to a one-night-stay;
while the muse of my verses is still far away.

Title: Sonnet 17
Author: William Shakespeare
Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were filled with your most high deserts?
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
The age to come would say “This poet lies;
Such heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces.”
So should my papers, yellowed with their age,
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
And your true rights be termed a poet’s rage
And stretchèd meter of an antique song.
But were some child of yours alive that time,
You should live twice—in it and in my rhyme.

Title: A Sonnet on Fidelity (Soneto de Fidelidade)
Author: Vinicius de Moraes 
If anything, to my love I'll stay true,
Always, and so much so that,
Faced with the life I never knew
Under my breath I'd wish for the old still

I want to live it in every moment I can borrow
To which land could hear me pray
To laugh my laugh or to cry my sorrow
To it's delight or it's dismay 

Just so you know, when you look for me later
I could be death, the anguish of the living
I could be solitude, the reaper of the loving 

Or I could tell of the love (that I had felt):
That while immortal it is not,
as long as it is flame.

But as long as it is flame,
Be it endless in its burning.

Title: Amor constante, allá de la muerte
Author: Francisco de Quevedo (tr. Rhina Espaillat)
When the last shadow comes to douse the white
radiance of day, it well may close my eyes;
it may unbind my soul, so that it flies
free, toward its eager wish, full of delight;

but soul will not abandon in its flight
memory, where it burned: my flame is wise,
knows how to swim the icy stream, and rise
to disobey the law more stern than right.

My soul, for whom the cell god’s will has been;
veins that have, for so long, nurtured such fire;
my very core, gloriously lit within,

will let the body go, but not desire;
will be ashes, but sentient as when skin;
will be dust, but dust in love upon the pyre.

Title: March 20th, 1928
Author: Virginia Woolf
The question now is, will my feelings for you be changed? I've lived in you all 
these months—coming out, what are you really like? Do you exist? Have I made you up?

But I dont want to write another word for months—not a letter even—Do you ever feel words have gone 
dry and dull in your mind? Your mind like a sponge in the dust? You squeeze it and nothing comes? In October 
my mind was dripping: That is the only life."
[...]
I am rather depressed.
Orlando so bad.
Cant write.
Can Love but then Vita's away.
Shant see her for ever so long.
But continue please to think me charming and write to me.

Virginia

Title: Cabo Machado
Author: Mário de Andrade (tr. me!)
Cabo Machado is java-apple colored,
A midget such as any Brazilian of value.
Cabo Machado is rather fine lad.
Like living-breathing daybreak in my eyes.
His mouth is ajar in an eternal scarlet smile
In his teeth the sunshine lies
In an exotic kind of grace.

Cabo Machado marches on
And it's seldom warlike.
Cabo Machado is a dancer in syncopy
Marches come-here-mulata.
Cabo Machado stands with raised head
And stares with niminy-piminy.

His eyes follow every conceited mean richie
That demean him based on his rank
And his java-fruit color.

Cabo Machado is gentle-delicate.
A gentleman of French education.
Cabo Machado is sweet as honey 
And made of tropical adoration.

Cabo Machado represents a land
Whose Constitution outlaws the wars of conquest
And carefully suggests the meeting-in-the-middle.
Just barely signs on it!
More love, less trust!
Cabo Machado curls into distress...

But holds manicured nails
In cold translucent hands 
Doesn't pass on the good-natured rice powdered face.
Clearly prefers the meeting in the middle.
And it all ends with a dance!
That's why Cabo Machado marches maxixe.

Title: Portuguese Language
Author: Olavo Bilac (tr. Rubens Chinali)

Last Lazian flower, uncultured and fair,
At once a splendour and a sepulture:
Thou native gold, that on a gangue impure
The crude mine among gravels watch and care.

Thus I love thee, that art unknown, obscure.
High clanging tuba, and a lyre so bare,
That hast the blast and hiss of the wild air,
The lull of longing, tenderness secure!

I love thine rustic lushness and thy scent
Of virgin forests and of ocean wide!
I love thee, O brute language of lament,

Which from my mother's voice I heard: "my son!",
In which Camoens in harsh exile has cried
The mind's misfortunes and love's light undone!

Title: Leftovers for later
Author: Adélia Prado (tr. me)
In my town, on sunday afternoons
The people sit in the shade with knives and oranges.
Drink from its juice, laugh at the man in the bike
with the screaming bell handle rimmed by orange peels
'What nonsense!"
when we far progress into the techno-illogical
When you can no longer tell if it's sunday
from the orange lush or bicycles
in my country of lament and memory,
closing your eyes is enough:
it is sunday, it is sunday, it is sunday.
